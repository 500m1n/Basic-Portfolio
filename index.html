    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <img src="assets/images/simpsons_PNG2.png">
    <p>My name is Danny and I'm a jack of all trades! I use to be heavily involved with music production and live production.
        My main focus is in cinematography/videography as a car enthusiast.
    </p>

    <p>Im never going to give you up. NEver going to let you down NEver going to run around and desert you. Never gonna make
        you cry never gonna say goodbyeeeeee never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.</p>

    <p>I often find myself wondering what im doing in my life. Sometimes i just sit on my roof stare at the stars while taking
        a giant hit of my vape. Pondering what is the meaning to life. Space the final frontier. Why is there billions of
        ads on the internet. Do people make money off of ads? Who doesnt have ad blocker nowadays. Why would people want
        to scam elderly who dont know any better? The world will never know. Like that one time bob took my ice cream and
        told me he can make two but ends up eating all my ice cream. While staring in horror ill never forget the feeling
        of being double crossed. Which leads me to today. Writing aimless text that actually make sense but at the same time
        not make sense. Like that profile picture of homer. The Simpsons great show. Really crude like south park but on
        a lite notch.
