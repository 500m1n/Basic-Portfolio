        <p>My name is Danny and I'm a jack of all trades! I use to be heavily involved with music production and live production.
            My main focus is in cinematography  /videography as a car enthusiast.

        <p>Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Explicabo quibusdam ullam, id mollitia aut blanditiis optio ad odio ipsa? Neque vero iusto a assumenda odio rem. Aliquam sint enim possimus?</p>

        <p>I often find myself wondering what im doing in my life. Sometimes i just sit on my roof stare pondering what is the meaning to life. Space the final frontier. Why is there
            billions of ads on the internet. Do people make money off of ads? Who doesnt have ad blocker nowadays. Why would
            people want to scam elderly who dont know any better? The world will never know. Like that one time bob took
            my ice cream and told me he can make two but ends up eating all my ice cream. While staring in horror ill never
            forget the feeling of being double crossed. Which leads me to today. Writing aimless text that actually make
            sense but at the same time not make sense. Like that profile picture of homer. The Simpsons great show. Really
            crude like south park but on a lite notch. This is a fake paragraph.
